# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### permission denied error
- 구글에서 검색한 입력어 : npm start permission denied mac
- 해결방법 링크 : https://heygabriel.medium.com/npm-start-permission-denied-error-how-to-solve-it-2387c7472319
- 왜 에러가 났나?
  - 윈도우 os 에서 작업한 폴더를 mac os에서 사용하려고 로컬에 설치했는데 react application 이 실행이 안됨
  - npm 명령어가 하나도 안 먹힘
  - 일단 어찌저찌 해결했는데 내가 node를 설치하고 node_modules 파일을 지웠다가 다시 받아서 그런가..? 
  - 앞으로 node 설치하고 난 후 관련 파일을 함부로 삭제했다가 다시 다운받고 이러지 말아야지..
  - 윈도우에서 잘 돌아가는지 다음에 확인 해봐야겠다...
